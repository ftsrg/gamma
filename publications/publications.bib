This paper presents a model-based integration test generation approach leveraging hidden formal methods based on the collaborating statechart models of the components. Statecharts can be integrated using various composition modes (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous) and then transformed (via a symbolic transition systems formalism -- XSTS) into the input formalisms of model checker back-ends, namely UPPAAL, Theta and Spin in an automated way. The model checkers are utilized for test generation based on multiple coverage criteria. The approach is implemented in our open source Gamma Statechart Composition Framework and evaluated on industrial-scale distributed controller subsystems from the railway industry.",

Generally, such systems are integrated using various reactive components and must carry out critical tasks. Accordingly, their systematic testing is vital, which can be hindered by their complexity and distributed nature. This paper presents a model-based test generation approach using hidden formal methods. It is based on the collaborating statechart models of the system components and parametric test coverage criteria configurable by declarative model queries. Statecharts can be integrated using various composition modes (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous) and then automatically mapped into the inputs of model checker back-ends, namely UPPAAL, Theta and Spin. The model checkers generate tests by traversing the emergent analysis models to cover the elements of the test model as specified by pattern-based model queries. The returned diagnostic traces are then concretized to different execution environments.

	abstract = {Abstract In recent years, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) practices have been applied in various industries to design, simulate and verify complex systems. The verification and validation (V\&V) of such systems engineering models are crucial to develop high-quality systems. However, this is a challenging problem due to the complexity of the models and semantic differences in how different tools interpret the models, which can undermine the validity of the obtained results if they go undiscovered. To address these issues, we propose (i) a subset of the SysML language for which the practical semantic integrity of tools can be achieved and (ii) a cloud-based V\&V framework for this subset, lifting verification to an industrial scale. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on an industrial-scale model from the aerospace domain and summarize the lessons learned during transitioning formal verification tools to an industrial context.},

	abstract = {Abstract Control systems are typically tightly embedded into their environment to enable adaptation to environmental effects. As the complexity of such adaptive systems is rapidly increasing, there is a strong need for coherent tool-centric approaches to aid their systematic development. This paper proposes an end-to-end component-based specification, design and verification approach for adaptive systems based on the integration of a high-level scenario language (sequence chart variant) and an adaptation definition language (statechart extension) in the open source Gamma tool. The scenario language supports high-level constructs for specifying contracts and the adaptation definition language supports the flexible activation and deactivation of static contracts and managed elements (state-based components) based on internal changes (e.g., faults), environmental changes (e.g., varying context) or interactions. The approach supports linking managed elements to static contracts to formally verify their adherence to the specified behavior at design time using integrated model checkers. Implementation can be derived from the adaptation model automatically, which can be tested using automated test generation and verified at runtime by contract-based monitors.}
