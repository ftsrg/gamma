/*
 *	Directives to Increase Speed
NOBOUNDCHECK	don't check array bound violations (faster)
NOCOMP	don't compress states with fullstate storage (faster, but not compatible with liveness unless -DBITSTATE)
NOFAIR	disable the code for weak-fairness (is faster)
NOSTUTTER	disable stuttering rules (warning: changes semantics) stuttering rules are the standard way to extend a finite execution sequence into and infinite one, to allow for a consistent interpretation of B\(u"chi acceptance rules
SAFETY	optimize for the case where no cycle detection is needed (faster, uses less memory, disables both -l and -a)
SFH  faster verification of safety properties, sets also NOCOMP (faster, uses slightly more memory, disables both -l and -a)
	* Directives to Reduce Memory Use
BITSTATE	use supertrace/bitstate instead of exhaustive exploration
COLLAPSE	a state vector compression mode; collapses state vector sizes by up to 80% to 90% (see Spin97 workshop paper) variations: add -DSEPQS or -DJOINPROCS (off by default)
FULL_TRAIL leaving this directive out significantly reduces memory in multi-core mode, but reduces error-trails to a suffix of the full trail only. adding it restores the capability to generate full error trails.
Only relevant in mult-core verifications; no effect elsewhere.
HC	a state vector compression mode; collapses state vector sizes down to 32+16 bits and stores them in conventional hash-table (a version of Wolper's hash-compact method -- new in version 3.2.2.) Variations: HC0, HC1, HC2, HC3 for 32, 40, 48, or 56 bits respectively. The default is equivalent to HC2.
MA=N	use a minimized DFA encoding for the state space, similar to a BDD, assuming a maximum of N bytes in the state-vector (this can be combined with -DCOLLAPSE for greater effect in cases when the original state vector is long)
MEMCNT=N	set upperbound to the amount of memory that can be allocated usage, e.g.: -DMEMCNT=20 for a maximum of 2^20 bytes
MEMLIM=N	set upperbound to the true number of Megabytes that can be allocated; usage, e.g.: -DMEMLIM=200 for a maximum of 200 Megabytes (meant to be a simple alternative to MEMCNT)
SC	enables stack cycling. this will swap parts of a very long search stack to a diskfile during verifications. the runtime flag -m for setting the size of the search stack still remains, but now sets the size of the part of the stack that remains in core. it is meant for rare applications where the search stack is many millions of states deep and eats up the majority of the memory requirements.
SPACE	optimize for space not speed
